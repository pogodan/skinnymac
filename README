This app was made by Pogodan(www.pogodan.com) as part of Culture Hack Scotland(www.culturehackscotland.com). It's written in MacRuby and displays a simple status bar icon with Interface Builder links to About/Quit. With horrifying inefficiency it reads in a giant CSV file and uses CoreLocation to calculate the events nearest to you, and dynamically adds them to the menu

We're releasing the code because there's not a lot of MacRuby examples out there. Please, please do not take this code as any indication of a good way to build a production app. Feel free to reuse the code for any purpose, but I wouldn't recommend it
